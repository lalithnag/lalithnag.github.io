# Lalith Nag

I've created this simple website to tell the world a little bit about myself and what I do.
On this site, you'll also find links to my past, links to relevant files and repos on GitHub.
You can checkout the site at

## lalithnag.github.io

Feel free to drop me a line, to give feedback, collaborate, or you know for a hot cup of coffee. :)

This site was built on Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
