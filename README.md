# Lalith Sharan

I created this simple website, so I could talk about the work I do; connect with and learn from people who do cool stuff.

On this site, you can read about my past and ongoing projects, and access relevant files and repos on GitHub. You can also download my CV, and read my blog.

You can checkout the site at <http://lalithnag.github.io>

Feel free to drop me a line - to give feedback, collaborate or you know, for just a hot cup of coffee. :-)

This site was built on Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
