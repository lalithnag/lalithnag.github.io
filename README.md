# Lalith Nag

I created this simple website, so I could talk about the work I do and connect and learn from people who do cool stuff.
On this site, you'll also find links to my past and ongoing projects, links to relevant files and repos on GitHub.

You can checkout the site at <http://lalithnag.github.io>

Feel free to drop me a line - to give feedback, collaborate or you know, for just a hot cup of coffee. :)

This site was built on Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
