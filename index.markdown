Hi, there! My name is Lalith, I am a researcher in the field of computer assisted surgeries,
with a focus on heart surgeries, in particular minimally invasive mitral valve repair.
I primarily work on endoscopic image analysis, using computer vision methods such as depth estimation, 
point detection, and augmented reality to enable quantitative and visual understanding of the heart.
Get in touch with me, to know more!

Here is my submission to the MICCAI Education challenge 2023:
