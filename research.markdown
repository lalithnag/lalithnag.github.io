My current research lies at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and cardiac surgery. In particular, the focus of my PhD is to use the computational tools at hand, to tackle important challenges in minimally invasive mitral valve repair, a surgery of the mitral valve of the heart. My cumulative dissertation is titled <i> Deep learning based image analysis for endoscopic minimally invasive mitral valve repair </i>.

<p style="font-size: 12px;"> 
Minimally invasive mitral valve repair, which is the gold standard to treat mitral regurigtation is a surgery that is routinely performed with endoscopic assistance. Owing to restrited surgical ports, high surgical complexity, and a lack of quantitative information; successful outcomes are impacted by intraoperative decision making. For example, choosing the right size of ring prosthesis and artificial chordae tendinae is of paramount importance to successfully restore the valve to its normal function. Endoscopic imaging presents a rich source of information that can be leveraged using computational tools, to assist in surgical decision making, and provide insights that help tackle the complexity of this surgery.

#### Contributions to open science

<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
<li> Code for all my papers are made publicly available (check my <a target="_blank" href="/pubs/">publications page</a> for individual repo links).</li>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"></div>

<li> An in-house dataset for suture point detection was curated, containing 2,376 intraoperative images, 2,708 surgical simulator images, and 50,000+ suture points. This dataset was released to the community as part of a publicly organised challenge (<a target="_blank" href="https://adaptor2021.github.io">AdaptOR 2021</a>) at <a target="_blank" href="https://miccai2021.org/en/">MICCAI 2021</a>. </li> 
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"></div>

<li> An extended clean stereo-endoscopic dataset from the intraoperative and surgical simulator domains was curated and publicly released to the community, for a novel view synthesis task as part of another publicly organised challenge (<a target="_blank" href="https://adaptor2022.github.io">AdaptOR 2022</a>) at <a target="_blank" href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/">MICCAI 2022</a>.</li>
<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"></div>

<li> I was part of various scientific outreach activities - I presented my research to a cumulative general audience of 3000+, in the form of <a target="_blank" href="/talks/">science slams</a>. </li>
